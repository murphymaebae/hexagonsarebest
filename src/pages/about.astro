  <h1>about</h1>
  <p class="lede">i design for humans first. i like bounded contexts, gentle interfaces, and teams that leave people better than they found them.</p>

  <h2>principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>kind systems:</strong> technology should reduce harm and increase agency.</li>
    <li><strong>domains over departments:</strong> organise by purpose, not org charts.</li>
    <li><strong>ecosystems, not empires:</strong> cultivate; don’t conquer.</li>
    <li><strong>clear interfaces:</strong> ubiqitous language, contracts, and trust.</li>
  </ul>
